This data source contains monthly Australian domestic airline on-time performance and reliability statistics aggregated by route and airline. Each row represents a route (departing and arriving ports) for a given airline and month, with counts for sectors scheduled, sectors flown, cancellations, and on-time vs delayed departures and arrivals. Use it to analyse punctuality, cancellation rates, seasonal trends, route or airport performance, airline comparisons, and to identify operational hotspots or anomalies over time.
