## Example 1: Make a Decision (Cost-Benefit Analysis)

### Scenario A: Marketing Team Tool Selection

**Prompt:**

I'm leading a marketing team deciding between purchasing an all-in-one project management tool or developing a custom solution in-house.
- Purchasing the software costs $10,000 up front, plus $1,000 per month for 12 months.
- Developing in-house is estimated to cost $25,000 in development expenses.

Show me the total cost for each option in a detailed cost-benefit analysis table and explain which approach you would suggest and why.

---

### Scenario B: Software Development Team Designer Decision

**Prompt:**

I am working with a software development team facing a decision: outsource or hire an in-house designer.
- Outsourcing would cost $20K up front and $5K per month for 6 months.
- Our in-house designer would cost $60K in salary.

Show me the total cost for each using a detailed cost-benefit analysis in a table format. Explain your suggestion.

## Example 2: Calculate Earned Value Management (EVM)

### Scenario A: Website Redesign Project

**Prompt:**

A website redesign project has a total budget of $200,000 and is scheduled to complete in 8 months. At the 4-month mark, the Actual Cost (AC) is $110,000, and the project is 40% complete.
- Am I over or under budget?
- Am I behind or ahead of schedule?
- What are the Earned Value (EV), Estimate to Complete (ETC), and Variance at Completion (VAC)?

Show this in a table format and highlight your explanation in bold.

---

### Scenario B: Digital Marketing Campaign

**Prompt:**

A digital marketing campaign project has an overall budget of $80K with a planned duration of 4 months. After 2 months, the actual cost (AC) is $45K while the project is 40% complete.
- Determine if the project is over or under budget, and whether it is ahead or behind schedule.
- Calculate the Earned Value (EV), Estimate to Complete (ETC), and Variance at Completion (VAC).

Present your analysis in a table format and highlight the explanation of your findings in bold.

---

### Scenario C: Software Development Project

**Prompt:**

A software development project has a $100K budget and a timeline of 6 months. After 3 months, the actual cost (AC) is $60K and the project is 50% complete.
- Am I over or under budget?
- Behind or ahead of schedule?
- What is the earned value (EV), Estimate to Complete (ETC), and Variance at Completion (VAC)?

Show this in a table format and highlight the explanation in bold.

## Example 3: Manage Risk

### Scenario A: Florida Construction Project (Hurricane Risk)

**Prompt:**

Consider a construction project in Florida where historical data shows a 15% chance of hurricanes causing significant delays. Despite this, the risk management plan did not include updated mitigation strategies. A recent forecast indicates a 25% chance of a hurricane hitting the region, potentially delaying the project by several weeks and incurring additional costs.
- Create a detailed risk analysis table addressing potential risks, their probabilities, impacts, and mitigation strategies.
- Emphasize your recommended solution for updating the risk management plan in bold.

### Scenario B: Automotive Manufacturer Supply Chain Risk

**Prompt:**

In 2020, a major automotive manufacturer relied on a single offshore supplier for specialized microchips. There was a 15% chance of a supply chain interruption due to global shipping constraints, yet no contingency plan was implemented. As a result, a critical shortage occurred, halting production for 2 months and costing the company over $50 million.

Show me how to address this risk using a detailed risk analysis table, and highlight the recommended solution in bold.

---

### Scenario C: Fukushima Nuclear Disaster (Tsunami Risk)

**Prompt:**

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 demonstrated poor risk management. Despite a 10% chance of a tsunami exceeding the planned maximum of 5.7 meters, TEPCO did not revise safety measures. The resulting 14-meter tsunami caused a level-7 nuclear disaster, costing over US$200 billion in damages and cleanup.

Show me how to solve this concisely using a detailed risk analysis table format. Highlight the suggested solution in bold.

## Example 4: Create User Stories

### Scenario A: Project Management Dashboard

**Prompt:**

A project management software company wants to enhance its platform with a new feature: a dynamic project dashboard that provides real-time updates on task progress, resource allocation, and budget consumption.
- **User Story**: Create a user story using the format: "As a [persona], I want [what] so that [desired outcome]."
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Outline criteria using the Given-When-Then format to validate the functionality of the dashboard.

Present the user story in one table and the acceptance criteria in a second table.

---

### Scenario B: Food Delivery Mobile App

**Prompt:**

A regional food delivery company needs a mobile application to let customers track and manage their meal deliveries in real time. Customers should be able to see delivery status, estimated time of arrival, and location tracking. Success will be measured by the number of on-time deliveries, customer feedback, and overall app usage. This data will influence future upgrades to the delivery management system.

Create an agile user story in two tables, using:
- As a [persona], I want [what], so that [desired outcome].
- Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format.

---

### Scenario C: Airline Mobile App for Frequent Flyers

**Prompt:**

A company requires an airline mobile app to allow frequent flyers to view and manage their upcoming flights. The app should enable users to make flight changes easily and stay organized. Success will be measured by the number of successful logins to the app, the number of flight changes made, and overall user satisfaction with the new feature. This data will inform future improvements to the app's flight management functionality.

Create an agile user story in two tables.
- For the user story, create a sentence using the phrases "As a [persona]," "I want [what]," and "so that [desired outcome]."
- The acceptance criteria use the Given-When-Then formula.
