## Tailoring Project Management Prompts

### Best Practices for AI Prompts

When working with ChatGPT, Copilot, or other AI chatbots:

1. **Be Clear and Specific** - Make instructions as clear and specific as possible
2. **Use Short Sentences** - Use short, clear, concise sentences
3. **Iterate** - Revise your questions based on the responses you receive
4. **Provide Context** - Include relevant project details and constraints
5. **Specify Format** - Request specific output formats (tables, bullet points, etc.)

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Cost-Benefit Analysis (Decision Making)

**Scenario**: Marketing team deciding between purchasing project management software or developing in-house

**Prompt Template**:
```
I'm leading a [team type] deciding between [Option A] or [Option B].
- [Option A] costs [details]
- [Option B] costs [details]

Show me the total cost for each option in a detailed cost-benefit analysis table 
and explain which approach you would suggest and why.
```

**Sample Application**:
- Purchasing software: $10,000 upfront + $1,000/month for 12 months
- In-house development: $25,000 development expenses

### Example 2: Earned Value Management (EVM) Calculations

**Scenario**: Website redesign project budget tracking

**Prompt Template**:
```
A [project type] has a total budget of $[amount] and is scheduled to complete 
in [duration]. At the [checkpoint] mark, the Actual Cost (AC) is $[amount], 
and the project is [percentage]% complete.

- Am I over or under budget?
- Am I behind or ahead of schedule?
- What are the Earned Value (EV), Estimate to Complete (ETC), and Variance 
  at Completion (VAC)?

Show this in a table format and highlight your explanation in bold.
```

**Sample Application**:
- Total Budget: $200,000
- Duration: 8 months
- Current Status (4 months): AC = $110,000, 40% complete

### Example 3: Risk Management

**Scenario**: Construction project hurricane risk analysis

**Prompt Template**:
```
[Describe scenario with risk details including probability and potential impact].
[Describe current state of risk management].

- Create a detailed risk analysis table addressing potential risks, their 
  probabilities, impacts, and mitigation strategies.
- Emphasize your recommended solution in bold.
```

### Example 4: Agile User Stories

**Scenario**: Project management dashboard feature

**Prompt Template**:
```
[Describe feature/functionality needed and business context]. Success will be 
measured by [metrics].

Create an agile user story in two tables:
- As a [persona], I want [what], so that [desired outcome].
- Acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format.
```
